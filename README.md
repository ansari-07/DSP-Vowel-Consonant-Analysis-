# DSP-Vowel-Consonant-Analysis-
"DSP-based vowel vs consonant analysis using MATLAB â€“ Summer Internship Project."
# Spectral and Temporal Analysis of Vowel and Consonant Sounds using Digital Signal Processing

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project was completed as part of my **Summer Internship** at **Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College**, under the guidance of **Dr. Jishan Mehedi**.

The goal was to perform **spectral and temporal analysis** of vowel and consonant sounds using **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** techniques in MATLAB.  
We compared vowel sounds (e.g., "A") and consonant sounds (e.g., "H") in **time-domain** and **frequency-domain**, and calculated key features like **Spectral Centroid** and **Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR)**.

## ðŸ“… Internship Duration
**10th June â€“ 18th July 2025**

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- MATLAB R2024a
- Audio recordings (`.m4a`)
- Sampling Frequency: 48 kHz

---

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology
1. **Audio Input** â€“ Reading vowel and consonant recordings using `audioread()`.
2. **Time-Domain Analysis** â€“ Plotting waveforms of vowel and consonant.
3. **Frequency-Domain Analysis (FFT)** â€“ Visualizing spectral content.
4. **Feature Extraction** â€“ Calculating:
   - Energy
   - Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR)
   - Spectral Centroid
5. **Comparison & Plotting** â€“ Comparing features between vowel and consonant.

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary
- **Vowel (A)**: Smooth, periodic waveform; energy concentrated in low frequencies.  
- **Consonant (H)**: Sharp, irregular waveform; energy spread across higher frequencies.  
- **Spectral Centroid**:
  - Vowel (A): **2906.18 Hz**
  - Consonant (H): **4629.90 Hz**
- Conclusion: Consonants involve more articulatory effort and contain more high-frequency content.
